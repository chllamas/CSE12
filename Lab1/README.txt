-------------
Description

This lab introduces schematic entry logic simulation, 
Multimedia Logic (MML).  Practice of 
truth tables and logic based on those truth tables are involved.

This file is the saved .lgi from MML containing all schematics and
logic based circuitry.

Instructions

The program can be opened using MML program for testing on correct 
schematics. When opened, simulate the program and use the switches 
to affect the three different outputs.  Each switch and the 
associated pattern has a different effect on the outputs.
