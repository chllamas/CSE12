Files

-
Lab5.asm

This file is the saved .asm from MARS that contains
the source code for the program as well as the pseudocode
documentation.

--------------
Instructions

The program must be ran with an implmentation file as Lab5.asm is only a header file.  It cannot be executed alone.  Once executed, the functions found in the header file can be called to "draw" the specified shapes and lines.
